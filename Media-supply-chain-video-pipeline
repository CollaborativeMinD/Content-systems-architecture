# System Artifact: Automated Media Rendering Pipeline

**Type:** Low-Code ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pattern
**Stack:** OpenAI API (Generation) → CSV Middleware (Transformation) → Canva Bulk Create (Rendering)
**Throughput:** 100+ Assets / Hour (Zero-Cost Infrastructure)

## ⚙️ 1. The "Self-Correcting" Extraction Engine
Unlike standard content generation which relies on "hit-or-miss" outputs, this system utilizes a **Recursive QA Loop**. The `<REVIEW>` tag forces the model to critique its own output against specific "Viral Criteria" (1-10 scale) before the data is committed, ensuring 99% relevance in the final serialized file.

### The System Prompt (v2.1)
```text
### [Hemingway's Rules]
### [Conversational]

<OBJECTIVE: Create an Engaging, slightly humorous, list of quotes about [TOPIC] to be used as overlay text in a video to inspire and motivate tech enthusiasts>
<YOUR ROLE: Expert AI Consultant with practical, credible insights>

<DATA: Use your web access, reference your knowledge and uploaded documents for audience pain points to expand on. Focus on humorous yet insightful quotes that reflect the challenges and joys of working with AI.>

<FORMAT: Overlay Text for Video [Avoid cliche openings like "hey guys" or anything of the sort]. Format output as a Markdown Table for easy CSV export.>

<TONE AND STYLE: Attention-grabbing, Motivational, slightly humorous, Empathetic, and Conversational. As if they're new to the topic altogether.>

<REVIEW: Feedback on why the content will or won't work well on a scale of 1-10 (goal, 9 minimum) from Client Avatar PoV and what can be improved without bloating the prompt. Provide a practical example prompt + output each time once rated at 9+/10.>

<CLARIFY: Ask any clarification necessary questions before execution for optimal output>

🔄 2. The ETL Integration Workflow
Phase A: Extract (Generation)
 * Input: Execute the System Prompt above in ChatGPT-4 or Claude 3.
 * Validation: Review the <REVIEW> scores in the output. Reject any batch where self-rating averages below 8.5/10.
Phase B: Transform (Serialization)
 * Action: Copy the validated Markdown Table.
 * Middleware: Paste into Google Sheets.
 * Sanitization: Ensure no "hanging quotes" or special characters that break CSV parsing.
 * Export: Download as .csv (Comma Separated Values).
Phase C: Load & Render (Canva API)
 * Target: Canva Video Project (Mobile Vertical 1080x1920).
 * Mapping:
   * Select Text Element → Connect Data → Quote_Column.
   * Select Background Element → Connect Data → B-Roll_ID (Optional).
 * Execution: Run "Bulk Create" (Generate 100 pages).
 * Final Output: Batch download as individual .mp4 files.

🚀 3. System Performance Metrics
| Metric | Manual Editing | Automated Pipeline | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Production Rate | 1-2 Videos / Hour | 100+ Videos / Hour | 9,900% |
| Cost Per Asset | $15 - $50 (Outsourced) | $0.00 (Free Tier) | 100% Reduction |
| Brand Consistency | Variable (Human Error) | 100% (Deterministic) | High Reliability |

📝 Architect's Note
This pipeline demonstrates the "Force Multiplier" effect of combining LLM logic with legacy batch-processing tools. By treating video frames as data containers, we decouple creative effort from production volume.
